# Metrenq #

### What? ###

* Metrenq is a web app that gives proper direction data to a user who intends to travel between two stations on the Delhi Metro.
* It was created as a fun weekend project, because I was fascinated by the idea of displaying the Delhi Metro map in a few lines of code, and then utilizing that data to find the path between two different points (stations).
* Here is a blog post about its working: https://tr.im/PwgG1
